    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store voter information collected through a contact form and displayed on an interactive map. A top-level collection, `voterInfo`, stores the `VoterInfo` entities. This design promotes data clarity and enables simple querying. Since no user authentication beyond anonymous is required based on the prompt, all data is stored in a single top-level collection.  The structure facilitates authorization independence as all information required to decide authorization is contained within each document. QAPs are supported because all documents within the `voterInfo` collection share the same security requirements, thus fulfilling structural segregation."
