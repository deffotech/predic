/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the VoterInfo application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to voter information, while restricting write access to authenticated users who must provide a matching document ID during creation.
 * Updates and deletes are disallowed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Voter information is stored in the top-level `/voterInfo/{voterInfoId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is enabled for all voter information.
 * - Only authenticated users can create new voter information entries.
 * - Updates and deletes are explicitly disallowed to prevent unauthorized modification of voter data.
 * - No schema validation is performed beyond authorization-critical fields, allowing for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `voterInfoId` is used to ensure that the document ID in the path matches the `id` field in the document data during creation, enforcing a type of ownership.

     * @allow (create) - Authenticated user can create a new voterInfo document if the document id matches the `id` field in the data.
     * @deny (update, delete) - No user can update or delete existing voter information.
     * @principle Public read access with owner-only writes is used for voter information.
